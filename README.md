# profile-Migration-scripts
this is a set of scripts that I use to move user data from one computer to a save location
and then use the restore script to move it from the save location to the new device

these works good on windows 7 systems, and mostly works on windows 10 as well.

because these are using robocopy, you can also use it as a basic backup script.

If you see an error or find that its missing something, please open an Issue about it.
